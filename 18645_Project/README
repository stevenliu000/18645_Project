Main.cpp contains the main SIFT implementation which is from OpenCV. The kernel
for convolution with column filter is defined in vert_conv.cpp. The kernel for
matrix-matrix substraction is defined in GaussianBlur_modified.cpp.

In the main.cpp, for gaussian blur, we are replacing OpenCV's implementation 
GuassianBlur in line 210 with our version GaussianBlur_modified in line 211.
For matrix-matrix substraction, we are replacing OpenCV's implementation
subtract in line 242 with our version substraction_kernel in line 242.
